```
Trust in Ethereum Foundation:
2.1% scored their trust in the EF at 5
2.9% scored their trust in the EF at 6
10.2% scored their trust in the EF at 7
28.9% scored their trust in the EF at 8
28.6% scored their trust in the EF at 9
26.5% scored their trust in the EF at 10
I was shocked with the amazing average score of 8.55/10
